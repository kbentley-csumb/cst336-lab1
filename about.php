              <p>I have been developing software in several languages and on many platforms since 1986 when I got my first computer, a Commodore 64. </p>
              <p>The following summarizes my programming experience. In some cases I haven't used a language continuously, so the experience listed is
                conservatively based on continuous usage.</p>

              <p>I have many interests, and too many hobbies. Some of the things I do with my time include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><span class="hobby">Outdoors</span>: Hiking, Fishing, Rafting, Boating, Camping, Exploring.</li>
                <li><span class="hobby">Mechanical Work</span>: I enjoy fixing and restoration of things like Cars, Boats, and even Airplanes.</li>
                <li><span class="hobby">Electronics</span>: I like to experiment and build stuff with electronics.</li>
                <li><span class="hobby">Cats</span>: I have a ton (7 to be exact) of cats. One is a stray we adopted, and one was a feral cat in the mountains that we tamed over several months. They are part of the family, and very well cared for. </li>
              </ul>
